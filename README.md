# deadBot IRC Client

Program is in very early stages.

## Usage

Go into the sourcecode and manually edit variables to suit server settings.

## TODO

* Make a class which accepts hash options.
* Class should include methods to separate out types of content from the server
(e.g., content from channel, content from private messages, content from
server, etc.)
* The above class should probably found some way to automatically parse certain
things separately to do certain things like respond to pings.
